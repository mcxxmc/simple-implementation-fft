# simple-implementation-fft
 A simple implementation for FFT algorithm, based on the book Introduction to Algorithms.


It supports both DFT and its reverse. Please refer to the test file (`fft_test.go`) for how to use.


Currently, it assumes that the length of the input to be a power of 2.


### TODO
1. enable inputs of variant lengths.
